## Who am I?

I'm CHFR, my main presence online is felt through my Youtube channel where I make 音mads, I like to draw and am currently (2023-03-02) studying at a "generalist" tech school. I generally gravitate towards SoL anime, though I did broaden my horizons thanks to my friends.

Focusing a bit more about 音mads, I've started doing them in 2017 at the beginning of my high-school years. There's been a noticeable decrease in uploads in recent years but my love for the medium is still strong, and I hope it continues to burn intensely.

I've been using *Reaper* for audio, and *After Effects* for visuals, though I've switched to *Davinci Fusion* last year (developing a love and hate relationship similar to the one with AE almost instantly, but that's probably deserving of its own article).

You can contact me on discord at **CH FR#4710**.
