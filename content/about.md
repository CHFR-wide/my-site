## Hello

I'm an 音MADmaker, artist(debatable), compsci student and apprentice at a company where I do NodeJS(sorry) web development.

I love Otomads, anime/manga/LNs, Itodenwa and other things.

Over the time I've spend making otomads, I always did audio on *Reaper*, but for visuals, I used *Vegas Pro 12*, then moved to *After Effects*, then *Davinci Fusion*, and now I'm using *Autograph*.
