On the night of June 30th 2023, I was browsing /a/ until I stumbled upon a particular thread, it was one of those "daily chapter thread", and focused on a series I hadn't heard of before, titled: GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class.

Being a fairly big enjoyer of Slice of Life and 4komas, I decided to give it a try. I looked the series up and found out it was actually completed, which convinced me to read it all the more, as I wouldn't need to wait for other chapters once I'd be done with it.

I went in not really knowing what to expect, and in this blogpost, I will recount my experience reading this manga, and what I have to say now that I've finished all seven volumes of it. Although... considering I'm going through the trouble of writing about it to begin with, you can pretty much guess the tone of this article already.

This blogpost will chronologically recount how I felt when reading this manga, I'll then give my thoughts on it.

## "This is pretty cute, and instructive too!"

As I got to the end of Volume two, I reached the afterword, which reads

*People generally agree (?) that these four-panels comics take an excessive amount of energy to read.*

*GA: GEIJUTSUKA ART DESIGN CLASS, Volume 2*

*Thank you for reading it*

*I'd be happy if you could nibble on the art knowledge without trusting it too much*

[- Satoko Kiyuduki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoko_Kiyuduki)

My initial reaction was along the line of "heh, true". After all, I do agree that one Slow Start chapter takes me quite longer to read than one Chainsaw Man chapter, despite the former being only 7 pages long.

But then, my mind started wandering on that second statement, which proved to be harder to listen to than I expected... I realized I was really enjoying those explanations.

Despite the warning (reiterated in later volumes), it is still undeniable that you can learn a lot of general art knowledge from this manga. The author never hesitates to make some of the dialog sound more like a class you're taking.

While one could think that these more technical bits could negatively impact immersion, I think it actually does the opposite: art occupies a huge place in the girls' lives, the way it is discussed and explained truly drills down in the reader's mind that they are **actively** learning it. Ayanoi High School's art curriculum is more than just a setting for the characters to thrive on, but rather a shared reality that everyone experiences, enjoys, and struggles against on their own level.

## "This is very colorful! And... brown?"

As I kept on reading, I grew more and more conscious of one small detail: the color pages... there's a lot of them.

Part of me understood that having color is convenient when you want to explain stuff about art, but seriously... there really is **a lot** of them! More than I've seen in any other kirara for sure! At least more than once every two chapters!

Eventually, I reached this page.

The second panel stuck with me through the rest of my reading, and made me realize how "brown" this manga really is.

The uniforms are a deep pleasant brown-ish red, wood is heavily used in constructions, and even the brightest walls still have a beige tint. The manga radiates an overwhelming feeling of warmth which didn't fail to soothe me as I read.

Later down the line, I heard from MJRMLKâ˜† that the author did work for JRPGs, which might have had a small influence on the style and choice of colors.

## "Hm...?"

The more I kept reading, the more I had that thought.

"hm?"

"hm?!"

![First page cover](images/geijutsuka/hm2.webp)

"hmmmm?!!!"

I wouldn't say "hm?" qualifies as a witnessing a life-changing picture of unbelievable quality. This feeling I had was more akin to a short rise of my eyebrows, and an approbative look, before going right back to reading. It's a conscious acknowledgement that "wow, the author sure went the extra mile there" whenever one witnesses a small detail.

This is not a feeling I'm unfamiliar with, after all, it's fairly common for manga to do this kind of thing. What really surprised me however, was how **often** I had these moments.

These chapter illustrations are, to me, a highlight of this manga. Because the manga is an exploration of art, the author has full freedom on what she wants to draw in these spaces, and most often draws it with great care and love for details.

The girls are picking a plaster bust, [how about we draw it from the bust's point of view](images/geijutsuka/pov.webp "_blank")?

The chapter is about model kits, so [let's draw a fully detailed one, with all its layers overlapping in great details](images/geijutsuka/model-kit.webp "_blank"), because why not?

Whenever a time period, or an artistic movement is described, you can be sure it'll be accompanied by a nice little illustration, imitating the style as much as possible.

I wont beat around the bush, I think the quality of the art is **really** good, and very inspiring to look at. When I started reading, all I knew was that I was getting into an old kirara manga about art, I never imagined my expectations would be so consistently exceeded.

## All form and all substance

While ripe with pretty pictures, this manga also manages to get you with its writing.

When reading, I encountered many different kinds of chapters:

- Some are shenanigans and goofing around.
- Some are about the students learning new techniques/styles in class.
- Some are focused on a character growing and understanding art/themselves better.
- Some focus on characters outside of the two main groups (first years/art club).
- Some tell two stories in parallel, which ends in those two groups almost crossing paths.

There are more but these examples can already give you an idea of how your read will not get boring with how many facets of art, character relationships, and school life, are being explored in each chapter.

Kisaragi-focused chapters stand out in particular, they usually start with her being stuck on an assignment or a personal project. By interacting with other students, her teachers, or even her own psyche, she manages to understand her shortcomings or learn something new, and ultimately overcomes the challenge. When following her through this journey, I often got invested in it, and felt great when seeing her growth as a person or an artist.

## How it all concludes (heavy spoilers)

One very recurring theme of this manga, is how the author will tease her readers with the prospect of the first years meeting the art club. A good deal of chapters end with them almost coming in contact, or them briefly interacting without much more coming out of it.

However, in the penultimate volume, the reader's patience is finally rewarded. Being understaffed for their art exhibition during the school festival, the art club is in a pinch, until the main 5 girls (all members of the go-home club) are brought in to lend a helping hand (after Namiko's sister, who was the previous president of the art club, pulled some strings to have it happen). 

During this short period, we get a glimpse of another world, one where both groups would've met earlier.

However, the school festival will eventually end, as does the school year.

## Wrapping everything up (ultra heavy spoilers)

![This was fun](images/geijutsuka/this-was-fun.webp)

As many school-life mangas do, GA does have a graduation arc, which is incidentally where it decides to end.

The author seemed determined to tie up all the loose ends of the story with this final volume:

- Awara seizes the opportunity to study abroad in France (kino), following the footstep of the previous art club president whom she respects;
- Pairings became more concrete, between Awara and Uozumi, and between Sotoma and Usami;
- Teachers have a few chapters of their own, sharing their motivations and drive for teaching;

Kisaragi, finally, is the one who gets the most development: on Awara's graduation day, she asks to join the art club, effectively saving it from being shut down, and solving Awara's internal struggle to either let it die, or to find someone suitable to pass the baton to.

As her friends naturally follow her in the art club, she then becomes the club president (a position uncharacteristically assertive for her archetype). The club, which was on the verge of disappearing less than one year ago, experiences a renaissance with the (now second years) main cast.

And life, at GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class, will go on...

Each person, on their separate way...

But all of them...
