### Welcome

Welcome to my blog. On here I will talk about various topics, ranging from MADmaking to programming, and maybe other stuff that comes to my mind. 

I'll probably extend the site's functionalities as I go, right now it's mostly just a space for blogs but eventually I may rewrite the "downloads" page from my old page, and add new links.

### Changelog

I like reading changelogs, hopefully you do too.

- *v1.0.1 (2023-07-16)* 
  - Increased SOVL by removing the default theme and writing a new and worst one from scratch.
  - Fixes favicon.ico, Yuidumb is back!
- *v1.0.0 (2023-03-02)* 
  - Rewrote the website in HUGO (check the [old-website](old) here).
